This repository contains scripts that makes forensic investigators life easy( my life easy? ). These are simple scripts( very simple ). These are not production scripts. I love python but i dont have a coding style. Trying to adopt a style so please bear with me. I am also trying to replicate the scripts in Powershell. Any suggestions/ideas welcome.
